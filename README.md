# TodoReact
Template for a development environment for React, ES6, Flux and Bootstrap

Use the following commands to start the application:

```
npm i
npm start
```

After that you can reach the app on http://localhost:8080/

On Windows the folder structure will be too deep and after you download the packages the node_modules folder cannot be deleted. Thanks npm :(
